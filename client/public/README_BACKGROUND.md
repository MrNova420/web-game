# Background Image Required

The `game-menu.html` file references a background image at `background.jpg` (line 30):

```css
background-image: url('background.jpg');
```

## To Add Your Background Image:

1. Upload your background image file to `client/public/background.jpg`
2. The menu will automatically display your image as the background

## Current Status:

❌ `background.jpg` is **not found** in `client/public/`

The menu will still work, but will show a black background until you add the image file.

## Expected Image:

Based on your description, this should be the "awesome background" image you created for the main menu.

## File Location:

```
client/public/
  ├── game-menu.html    ✅ (uses your original HTML)
  └── background.jpg    ❌ (needs to be added)
```
